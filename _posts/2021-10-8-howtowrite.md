I've been recommended by my PhD supervisor to watch the video [Demystifying the Writing of a Scientific Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQmbN5hWhu8).
Super interesting and fully recommendable in my opinion too. As a teaser I'll 
present a summary here, that I will structure in 3 axis: plagiarism, clarity and revision.

**Plagiarism** definition she gives is 'using their ideas without explicitely acknowledging the original source'.
I guess it's fairly obvious what it means. Rules are inflexible and it's easy to detect.
The part I used to wonder about was, what to do when something is so well written in the 
original article, that any rephrasing would make it worse. 
They spent years of research to distill their ideas into their most compact and clean version. 
Do I copy paste with quotes?
What if I already cited the article above. Do I have to cite it again when I make these
references to their text or is it enough citing the article once to avoid adding extra
characters to the text that will make it longer.

I liked her suggestion: rephrase everything anyway. You want to work on your communication skills
since if you chose to do a PhD, is probably because you want to communicate new ideas, 
so, you can only gain by taking every opportunity to work on your communication skills. Rinse and repeat.

**Clarity**

Clarity makes the best impression. It is a mistake to think that you will gain
something by making things look complicated: what you write should appear clear.
Things can be complicated, but look simple.
I liked an idea she stated in relation to this: when you will measure how successful
you were, you will measure it by what you did, but as well by what others did
because of what you did. Clarity is thus a tool to help others use your work.
 
She suggests to be precise

**Revision, revision, revision**

If to sell a house the three most important things to consider are location, location, 
location, to write an article the three most important things are revision, revision,
revision. It's not only about the edits, the grammar, spelling: it applies to the flow of ideas.

There's no way you will write a good paper on the first try, even having written hundreds
of articles like she has. And it RRR applies to everybody, not only at the beginning
of your career. So, be patient. And interesting observation, RRR applies importantly to 
self revisions: it's not enough to readjust it once, and send it to a collegue for an advice,
you have to revise it many times yourself before asking for an opinion.

Be as well aware of your writer bias, we all have certain tendencies. Some of us tend to be verbose,
other terse, other struggle with their English. I think one of my biases is that at times 
I tend to over argue things. To defend an argument I tend to write too many things to defend it, and
that can cause the reader to disconnect, or lose the flow and the purpose of the read. My advisor
calls it 'noyer le poisson': 'to drown the fish'. So in the video she says: know your bias, and
compensate for that natural bias.

One observation she made that I liked was that you don't have to stick to the order of 
ideas of the first version. And a cool advice about it: make sections, paragraphs as independent as 
possible so in the revision process you can move them around.

  - tell a story
    - no sudden ideas
    - no meandering
    - don't start with the day you were born
    - order of presentation is the most difficult part and most important
    - before you start writing, think on the flow of the ideas
    - practice the flow of ideas with your workmates
    - after lunch try a different order
    - chronology is not usually relevant
    - explain the way you wished you got there, the quickest and clearest
  - simple declarative sentences
    - eliminate all unnecessary words
  - use paragraphs
    - paragraphs let us catch our breath mentally
  - scan and read
    - know your audience
    - tendency to read first line of each paragraph/section
    - inverted piramid for paragraphs, to the extent possible
  - clarity 
    - be specific, precise in your language
    - avoid generalities: behaviour, good, better
    - avoid listing the obvious
      - don't repeat what is in the graph
    - avoid redundancy
      - you are going to lose the reader and they are going to think you don't have as much to contribute
      - if you repeat sth important say why, don't just repeat it
