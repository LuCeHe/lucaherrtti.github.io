title: Desample and Deslice

This is a hyper-technical post, only for despicable freaks like me.
Maybe somebody is looking for similar functions so if that's the case, feel free to copy paste.
For a project I'm working on, I needed to sample a tensor, but keep it inside the original tensorflow graph.
So I had to sample the tensor, keep the remainder, and then get back the original tensor together, as if
nothing had happened. I found a way to do it. I call it sample and desample. For another part of the project
I needed a random slice of a multidimensional tensor, and put it back to its original form, to have it
back in the graph. I call it slice and deslice. I'm going to explain how I did it, and how it works.
You can find the code [here](https://github.com/LuCeHe/GenericTools/blob/master/GenericTools/keras_tools/convenience_operations.py), 
and give a try to the containing package that I'm building [here](https://github.com/LuCeHe/GenericTools).
I'd love to get some feedback.

The ```sample_axis``` function selects randomly items

```python
def sample_axis(tensor, max_dim=1024, axis=1):
    if tensor.shape[axis] > max_dim:
        newdim_inp = sorted(np.random.choice(tensor.shape[axis], max_dim, replace=False))
        out_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, indices=newdim_inp, axis=axis)
    else:
        out_tensor = tensor

    if tensor.shape[axis] > max_dim:
        remaining_indices = list(set(range(tensor.shape[axis])).difference(set(newdim_inp)))

        shuffled_indices = newdim_inp + remaining_indices
        deshuffle_indices = np.array(shuffled_indices).argsort()

        remainder = tf.gather(tensor, indices=remaining_indices, axis=axis)
    else:
        remainder, deshuffle_indices = None, None

    return out_tensor, remainder, deshuffle_indices
```

Luckily the random indices can be created with numpy, since the gradient won't need to pass through them, even though 
it might still be good idea to make those functions in tf.
