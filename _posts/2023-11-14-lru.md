title: Linear Recurrent Unit in TensorFlow 2.0

I wanted to check if [my RNN theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12075) worked on state-space models.
So I implemented the Linear Recurrent Unit in TensorFlow 2.0, and since I have it, why not to share it?
I tried to make it a clean code that could be easy to use and understand. In the coming days I'll turn it into a pip package.
The LRU was introduced in [Resurrecting Recurrent Neural Networks for Long Sequences](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3618408.3619518) at ICML, and 
belongs to the state-space models family, which are models able to handle extremely long sequences more
gracefully than attention based architectures. You can find [here](https://github.com/NicolasZucchet/minimal-LRU/blob/main/lru/model.py)
the JAX implementation that I took as a reference, as recommended by one of the authors of the LRU.

I'd like to complete the job with a JAX and PyTorch implementations. 
However, parallel scans are not implemented 
native in PyTorch, as noted [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/95408).
However custom implementations exist, such as [this one](https://github.com/i404788/s5-pytorch/blob/74e2fdae00b915a62c914bf3615c0b8a4279eb84/s5/jax_compat.py).

I implement the LRU unit and also the final LRU residual block used in the paper. For both
I provide a recurrent form and a scan form. In my tests, the scan form was up to 300x faster
than the recurrent form on a GPU, giving the same output. You can import them as follows:

```python
from lru_unofficial.tf.linear_recurrent_unit import LinearRecurrentUnitCell, LinearRecurrentUnitFFN
from lru_unofficial.tf.linear_recurrent_unit import ResLRUCell, ResLRUFFN
```

Enjoy!
