This article was written by Xiaohe Zhou, after all her struggles to settle in Milan as a non-EU researcher. She is currently a postdoc at the University of Milan, Bicocca.


This document is valid within the Comune di Milano only!
Policies vary across different regions and could be updated simultaneously. Although you may still use the information below as a reference, it is highly recommended that you go to the government website (Ministero dell'Interno) and contact your international office for assistance.

For a non-EU citizen, you must take the following steps upon arrival in Italy:
- Within 8 working days, apply for one of the following based on the duration of your stay:
    - Declaration of Presence (Dichiarazione di Presenza): Sending an email to international office. Both short stay (<90 days) and long stay (>90 days).
    - Stay Permit (Permesso di Soggiorno): Necessary for longer stays, such as study/work/family reunification.

For type D visa holders:

The application of permesso di soggiorno is stated as follows:

### I. Complete the Stay Permit Application - 1st appointment with Prefettura

To start the process, you need to obtain the "Kit Permesso di Soggiorno" upon your arrival. You can get this kit at the International Office. The kit includes following documents in your application (also they may be found in the appointment booking receipt from Prefettura):

Required Documents
1. Passport Copies
2. Proof of working contract 
3. Health Insurance
4. Proof of Housing:
   - A copy of a housing contract in your name.
   - Alternatively:
     - Owner's Consent Declaration + Cessione di Fabbricato (if hosted by relatives or friends).
     - Comunicazione di OspitalitÃ  (if hosted directly by the apartment owner). You may download the forms from [here](https://www.comune.milano.it/web/milanoaiuta/documenti).

5. Revenue Stamp (â‚¬16):
   - Purchase a Marca da Bollo (revenue stamp) for â‚¬16 at any tobacco shop.

**What you will receive:**

1. **MOD 209 modulo 1.**
This form includes personal information (name, date of birth, nationality), passport details, visa details, and contact information.
Purpose:
Used to officially request the issuance or renewal of a Permesso di Soggiorno (stay permit).

2. **MOD 209 modulo 2.** The one that includes contract (il contratto di soggiorno).
Another part of the MOD 209 form, includes terms of employment (e.g., salary, job description), confirmation that the employer will provide suitable accommodation for the employee and the employerâ€™s commitment to cover the employeeâ€™s repatriation costs if necessary. 
It is specifically required for certain stay permits. Like work or research.

### II. Submit Your Kit at the Post Office

You must personally deliver the open envelope with copies of all documents from step 1. to one of the authorized Post Offices. 

Friendly and English-speaking staff ðŸ¡ª Post office at Duomo:

Via Cordusio, 4, 20123 Milano MI

**Required Documents:**
1. Passport
2. Kit
3. Payments
   - â‚¬62.46 for stays of one year or less. Research permit is always 1 year for the first time.
   - Extra â‚¬60, unknown charge
   - Service fee of â‚¬31.50 to send your application to the Immigration Office (Questura).


**What You Will Receive:**

1. Postal Receipt

2. Payment Receipts of service fee

3. Appointment Letter:

   - A document specifying the date, time, and location of your appointment at the Immigration Office (Questura)


NOTE:  In order to get the longest stay permit (12 months starting from the date of your arrival in Italy) make sure that all the above documentation is valid until the necessary lapse of time (which means since your housing contract decides which Questura is responsible for collecting your bioinformation, do not move outside the region where youâ€™ve booked appointment with Questura. Otherwise you might get rejected.)
Once the stay permit is issued, no modification is possible. If the duration of your stay permit is shorter than your study period you will have to apply for renewal. **BUT NO NULLA OSTA IS NEEDED** If there is something wrong on the stay permit (e.g. surname, date of birth, expiry date) the Officer must be informed immediately! 


## TRIVIA

**Traveling during first stay permit application:**

You can travel to the other Schengen Countries without your residence permit:
Within the first 90 days with a valid Schengen visa. 
After 90 days you will need to always bring receipt from step 1. But still you need to check the regulations of different Schengen areas carefully before travelling. 

**Integration Agreement ("Accordo di Integrazione")**

If you are a new incoming international employee staying in Italy at least one year and you are applying for the first Italian stay permit, you must undersign the Ã¢â‚¬ËœIntegration Agreement' when you attend the appointment with the Immigration office.
You will receive an email (sometimes you have to find it in trash mailbox.Title: FORMAZIONE CIVICA). It is an introductory course on what is "Accordo di Integrazione" and how to participate in this program. If you wish to spend more than one year in Italy, it is recommended for you to attend the course.

**Congratulations!** Once youâ€™ve obtained your residence permit receipt, you now hold the key to start your experience in Italy! Here are the important documents and benefits that become accessible to you (application timeline follows the listing chronically):
All service appointments can be conveniently scheduled online through the portal of the comune where you reside.
