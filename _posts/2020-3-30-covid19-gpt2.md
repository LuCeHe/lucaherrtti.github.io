For those that are interested in Language Generation, here I'll show you how to use the 
[HuggingFace/Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html) library to finetune 
[GPT2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), on the 
[Kaggle Covid19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).
Ideally the goal is to make an automatic scientist. If it is 
first finetuned on a larger scientific dataset and then finetuned on the covid19 dataset the connections that the 
algorithm would make would be more interesting. The full code is available [here](https://github.com/LuCeHe/covid19_gpt2).

The [HuggingFace/Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html) project makes things very easy or 
those that want to start playing around with Transformers, but as well for those that want to quickly deploy high 
quality code for a business idea. In our case we will only have to reformat the text we want to feed to the network 
in the way it will understands it. Fortunately HuggingFace have thought that the simplest way is to feed the text as a
.txt file. Since the Kaggle dataset is provided in .json, we will first reformat the data using 
[xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv)'s convenience functions, and saving 
each article as a string followed by a '<|endoftext|>', that will tell the network the article is over. So, the final
covid19.txt file that we are going to train the network on, is just a long sequence of articles.


# how to use this code
1. create a `data` folder, download the dataset inside and unzip it
2. run `reformat_data.py`
3. run the following command for finetuning gpt2: 

```pythonscript
python run_language_modeling.py \
              --output_dir=output   \
              --model_type=gpt2   \
              --model_name_or_path=gpt2-medium \
              --do_train \
              --train_data_file=data/covid19.txt \
              --do_eval \
              --eval_data_file=data/small_covid19.txt   \
              --overwrite_output_dir \
              --block_size=200 \
              --per_gpu_train_batch_size=4  \
              --save_steps 200000 \
              --num_train_epochs=1
```

4. run the following command for generating samples from the finetuned model: 

```pythonscript
python run_generation.py \
              --model_type=gpt2 \
              --model_name_or_path=output \
              --k=10 \
              --length=200 \
              --num_return_sequences=3 \
              --prompt="The reason why covid19 finished"
```

# interesting samples

The outputs are still repetitive and not very informative. However I will put here the ones I found to be more interesting and the code used for generating it.

## sample 1

```pythonscript
python run_language_modeling.py --output_dir=output --model_type=gpt2 --model_name_or_path=gpt2-medium --do_train --train_data_file=data/covid19.txt --do_eval --eval_data_file=data/small_covid19.txt --overwrite_output_dir --block_size=200 --per_gpu_train_batch_size=4 --save_steps 200000 --num_train_epochs=1
python run_generation.py --model_type=gpt2 --model_name_or_path=output --k=10 --length=200 --num_return_sequences=3 --prompt="The reason why covid19 finished"
```

=== GENERATED SEQUENCE 3 ===

The reason why covid19 finished as the top 10 was not clear. It is possible that it was a result of the fact that many of the participants were not in the hospital and/or had to go home for other reasons. We cannot rule out the possibility of an effect due to the small number of people who were infected and/or the fact that the participants were in hospital for longer than 5 days.

Discussion

We conducted this study with a small sample size of a small sample of individuals, with a relatively large number of participants and with the aim of developing an evidence-based approach to the management of COVID-19. The findings of this study support the recommendations of the Chinese Government and WHO, which have emphasized the importance of rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients who are infected with COVID-19.The findings of this study show that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and contact precautions is the key to reducing the number of cases and deaths. In particular, the use of a mask

## sample 2

```pythonscript
python run_language_modeling.py --output_dir=output --model_type=gpt2 --model_name_or_path=gpt2-medium --do_train --train_data_file=data/covid19.txt --do_eval --eval_data_file=data/small_covid19.txt --overwrite_output_dir --block_size=200 --per_gpu_train_batch_size=4 --save_steps 200000 --num_train_epochs=1
python run_generation.py --model_type=gpt2 --model_name_or_path=output --k=20 --length=400 --num_return_sequences=3 --prompt="The most effective vaccine for covid19"
```

=== GENERATED SEQUENCE 2 ===

The most effective vaccine for covid19, the rRBD-based vaccine, is in phase II/III trials, but there are still concerns about its safety. To address these concerns, we used a live attenuated virus (strain SZ16) to express the RBD in a replication-defective (RdRp) form and inactivated it at high temperatures for 10 min. This was followed by a booster dose of SZ16 and a boost with the rRBD. The SZ16 vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies and was found to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity. It is the first RBD-based vaccine for COVID-19, and the rRBD-based vaccine is the first live attenuated vaccine for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Introduction

In December 2019, a new coronavirus pneumonia was identified in Wuhan, China. It was named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and it was rapidly identified in patients from Wuhan. By July 10, 2020, it had spread across the world, infecting over 27 countries in the world, and causing over 8,400 deaths [1]. In the disease caused by 2019-nCoV was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and it is highly contagious, with more than 80 % of cases were reported as pneumonia, and more than 10,000 cases died in the USA and China [2]. It is caused the largest ever epidemic outbreak in human respiratory diseases, and the mortality rate of 2019-nCoVirus (HCoV is about 40-related disease has exceeded that of the previous epidemic in China, and has been caused about 5, with the world's population in the last year [3]. The epidemic, and the number of people infected about 3, the world and the total number of infected by January 1. We found that was about 8,000, with the total is the
