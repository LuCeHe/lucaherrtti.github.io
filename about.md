### Brief Bio

I do research on Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience, 
with a focus on Gradient Stability. We found it is an effective framework
to [understand spiking neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00282). I'm personally
grateful to Wolfgang Maass and Alexandre Pouget for the opportunity 
to do an internship at  their labs. We also found
that gradient explosion was misunderstood for deep RNNs, since an [additive 
exponential explosion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12075) was never correctly
described. In that work we also propose pretraining to stability as an effective 
strategy to improve generalization ability of an unconstrained range of deep RNNs.
We built the [HoME dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11017) in 
collaboration with MILA, Aaron Courville and Hugo Larochelle, for multimodal embodied learning. 
We also designed [U-BESD](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9763007),
a neural network to help the hearing impaired isolate the sound they are
trying to attend to. I recently submitted
my thesis at Universit√© de Sherbrooke under the supervision of Jean Rouat, 
and I am defending on April 10th 2024.

Essentially I've used several variants of Deep Learning for my research, 
including recurrent, convolutional, transformers, neuromorphic architectures and
state-space models. I've used matrix norms, 
eigenvalues and Random Matrix theory to understand the stability of these architectures.
I'm currently refining my last work using Probability Theory concepts such as 
Chebyshev's inequality, and Analytic Combinatorics tools such as 
the saddle point method, generating functions and coefficient extractors to understand the stability of deep RNNs.


I want to mathematically describe cognition and come up with mathematical theories that can predict 
architecture quality before training. Somehow, I would like to use it to solve at least one disease :)
