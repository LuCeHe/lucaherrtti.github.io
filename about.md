### More Information!

After a journey that took me from Physics to Biophysics, Computational Neuroscience and finally 
Machine Learning, I found a new puzzle to solve in between Human Language and Deep Learning.

I'm going to give a try at a Research Mission, and I want to keep it bombastic, to have 
an attractive vision to push me to achieve it.
I want to mathematically describe cognition and come up with mathematical theories that can predict 
architecture quality before training. Somehow, I will use it to solve all the diseases.
